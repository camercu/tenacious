//! Testing retry logic deterministically with `clock::VirtualClock`.
//!
//! Run: `cargo run --example testing-with-virtual-clock`
//!
//! The lesson: structure production retry code to accept its clock as a
//! parameter. Production wires the default `SystemClock` (wall time +
//! `std::thread::sleep`); tests wire a `VirtualClock`, whose waits advance
//! virtual time instead of blocking and drive elapsed time from the same
//! cell — so timeout and backoff behavior is asserted exactly, in zero real
//! milliseconds, and the wait source and elapsed source can never disagree.
